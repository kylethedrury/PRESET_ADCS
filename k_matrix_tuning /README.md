Figures folder contains the plots for first attempt at fitting

tuning.ipynb is where I tried to tune the K-Matrix the first time
tuning_v2.ipynb is where I tried the second time after changing the inertia tensor to a diagonal matrix, and incorperating solutions to the errors that Arif noticed (namely, differentiating the magnetic field vector correctly, and not 
the B terms. The second try at fitting was much worse, could not get convergence. Going back to the drawing board.
